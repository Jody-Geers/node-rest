# node-rest

  RESTful web service, talks to mysql, returns JSON.

  An example written in Node.js; because Javascript rocks!

  Extendable to suite your needs. Index.js acts as the router / server. From then on out, data hits controller, based off incoming specifications controller asks service for data interaction and the model representation is used and or returned to client.
